### Hi there 👋


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my back-end programming languages
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to compose the visual elements of a webpage properly
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on various projects involving web development
- 🤔 I’m looking for ka-late night talks hehe... about coding obcurs <3
- 💬 Ask me about something personal :]
- 📫 How to reach me: @markndrei on instagram || Facebook : Mark Andrei Encanto
- 😄 Pronouns: He
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love myself ONLY;)
  
I am not proficient with the previously tackled programming languages (i.e., CPP, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS). But, I am open with various academic intercourses that could potential enhance my skills in back-end developing.
