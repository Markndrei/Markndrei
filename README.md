### Hello, It's Mark with the K

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to compose visual elements of a webpage properly
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on various projects involving web development
- 🤔 I’m looking for ka-late night talks hehe... about coding obcurs <3
- 💬 Ask me about something personal :]
- 📫 How to reach me: @markndrei on instagram || Facebook : Mark Andrei Encanto
- 😄 Pronouns: He
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love myself ONLY;)
  
I am not proficient with the aforementioned programming languages (e.g., CPP, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS). But, I am open to various academic intercourses that could potentially enhance my skills in back-end developing.
