### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my back-end programming languages
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use the Python language
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various projects involving web development
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning back-end developing languages
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about something personal :]
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @markndrei on instagram || Facebook : Mark Andrei Encanto
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love myself ONLY;)
  
I am not proficient with the previously tackled programming languages (i.e., CPP, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS). But, I am open with various academic intercourses that could potential enhance my skills in back-end developing.
