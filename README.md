### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to compose visual elements of a webpage properly
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various projects involving web development
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for ka-late night talks hehe... about coding obcurs <3
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about something personal :]
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: @markndrei on instagram || Facebook : Mark Andrei Encanto
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love myself ONLY;)
  
I am not proficient with the aforementioned programming languages (e.g., CPP, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS). But, I am open to various academic intercourses that could potentially enhance my skills in back-end developing.
